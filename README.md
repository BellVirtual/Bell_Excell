# Bell_Excell
OUT OF DATE VERSION-CURRENT VERSION IS PINNED TO MY FRONT PAGE
This is a python app built to automate excel data from Zoom Info. It uses the Pandas module to automate excel data entry as well as the TKinter module for a rudimentary front end. THIS IS IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM the most efficient way to implement this however it is a proof of concept. NOTE the file path must be declared in the BellExcell.py file.
